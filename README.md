# sort_and_search

## Description

This Python project demonstrates searching and sorting algorithms:

- Linear Search – It looks for the number 9 in the unsorted list 'numbers' and returns its index.
- Insertion Sort – It sorts the 'numbers' list in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
- Binary Search – It searches for the number 9 in the sorted list using Binary Search, which is faster than linear search for sorted lists.
